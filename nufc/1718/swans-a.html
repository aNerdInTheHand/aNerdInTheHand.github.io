        <!-- MAIN REPORT -->
        <p class="match-report-text">
          In the absence of Rafa Benitez, watching at home recovering from an operation, Francisco Moreno's and Mikel Antia's side delivered a perfect away performance that will hopefully have left the stricken gaffer feeling much better.<br>
          <br>
          Missing serial offenders Mitrovic and Shelvey - the latter being left on the bench by the management committee to think about what he did - Newcastle looked set up to sit back and contain Swansea. After 20 minutes we were being pushed back further and further until our back line was practically sat in the stands. Thankfully, they probably could have for all the threat the Swans posed.<br>
          <br>
          Much of the talk before the game was around the strengthening done by Swansea late in the transfer window. The only thing more surprising than their capture of Renato Sanches from Bayern Munich was their paying £15m for Sam Clucas. But overspending or not (with Sanches costing between £4m and £8m for one season depending on who you believe), they had at least strengthened their squad in a manner in sharp contrast to ourselves. Was today a sign that we were right not to take part in the hyper-inflated transfer silly season? I still think it's far too soon to say that, and that we should have strengthened further. What is clear though is that Rafa and his team seem able to eke every ounce out of this set of players.<br>
          <br>
          The first half consisted of Swansea getting the ball to Sanches, playing on the right of a diamond, at every opportunity, and Sanches then losing the ball. Over the course of his debut in English football, he lost the ball an impressive 23 times. That was more down to the fact that he was harried and harrassed by our midfield and defence rather than that he's become a poor player overnight. He never once got past a Jesus Gamez who didn't look as though he's hardly played in the last couple of years. He rarely even got that far, perhaps losing the stomach for the fight after being, shall we say, introduced to the Premier League after eight minutes by Isaac Hayden.<br>
          <br>
          Having comfortably survived the pressure from Swansea that never produced any real chances, Newcastle started to grow into the game in the second quarter of the game. Ten minutes before half time, Ritchie curled a cross with pace into the box that Joselu nodded accurately to the far corner, but Flappy Handski pulled off a remarkable save to keep the Spaniard out. Two minutes later and both teams were lucky - Swansea because Merino's absolutely rank dive in the box wasn't bought by the ref, and Newcastle because that means he can't become the guinea pig for retrospective action for diving. After some initial confusion it was clarified that retrospective action can only be brought if an advantage is actually gained by the dive.<br>
          <br>
          What had been in truth a pretty boring first half came to life in these last 10 minutes, with Mawson heading over from a corner for Swansea when he should have probably scored, and Jamaal Lascelles inexplicably trying to clear the ball from our box with a diving groin clearance. And the second half began with a distinctly groin-themed opening, with both Renato Sanches and Hayden taking blows to the wangers, much to the delight of the ref who saw the funny side. There was one foul that had Newcastle hearts in mouths, however, particularly after Mane's dismissal for Schumachering Ederson yesterday. Matt Ritchie had eyes only for the ball but caught Alfie Mawson just below the face with his studs stretching for a high ball. The fact that Ritchie couldn't reach Mawson's face if he had a springboard coupled with the fact that Mawson admirably walked it off (take note Ederson, none of this getting stretchered off unconscious!) probably led to Mike Jones taking a lenient, but also correct, decision of a yellow card. Perhaps the controversy surrounding Mane's red was also playing on his mind. It was nice to see one of these decisions go in our favour for once though.<br>
          <br>
          On the hour mark Swansea were beginning to dominate once more, with Rob Elliot being called into action to make a smart stop at his near post from Tom Carroll. Two minutes later came the moment that defined the game. A moment of dawdling by Lascelles saw Rafa-target Tammy Abraham burst through the defence and round Rob Elliot and hit the ball towards the open goal from six yards. However, Lascelles had shown a true captain's desire to make up for his error and had thundered back towards goal, hurling himself in front of Abraham's shot and bundling it out for a corner. Newcastle seemed to take strength from this and, similar to the first half, began to grow more and more into the game. Swansea took this as cue to introduce another new signing, bringing on Wilfried Bony for his second debut. Let's all just take a moment to consider that Bony, that's Bony the CENTRE FORWARD, was criminally bedecked with the number 2. The game's gone.<br>
          <br>
          As the game went on and became more stretched, we looked more and more comfortable, and in a small and quiet part of my mind I started believing we could come away with a hard earned point. But then Captain Fantastic decided he had other ideas, and took advantage of the ridiculous fad of zonal marking to power in a header from a Ritchie corner. An expected onslaught just didn't materialise from the home side, whose fans must have been left extremely disappointed by this performance. But today was all about the work rate and performance of a motivated and talented Newcastle team. Get well soon Rafa!
