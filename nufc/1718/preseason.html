      <p class="card-text">Preseason... a tantalising taste of what's to come, but never quite the real deal.<br>
      <br>Supposedly an opportunity for all the new signings to gel into the team, but in these days of <span class="TRANSFERWINDOWDAY">JIM WHITE SHOUTING DAY</span>, aka <span class="TRANSFERWINDOWDAY">TRANSFER DEADLINE DAY</span>, it seems unfashionable to sign anybody before you're three games into the season. That's maybe a little bit unfair, as we got 5 in - plus a few kids - before the first league game, and as I write have subsequently added Joselu. By and large I don't think any of them are bad signings, but by Rafa's own admission there aren't many of his first choices amongst them.<br>
      <br>
      <span class="player-highlight">Christian Atsu</span> ended last season well and general consensus amongst my mates is that it was a no brainer to sign him for the price (a rumoured £6m or thereabouts, or 1/33 Neymars in modern currency). His early season form (I'm writing this after the West Ham game having decided on a whim to start this blog) suggests he could well be a bargain.<br>
      <br>
      We then completed the signing of <span class="player-highlight">Florian Lejeune</span> after about 10 years of negotiations, presumably along the lines of:<br>
      "We'll give you €5m."<br>
      "The price is €8m."<br>
      "We'll give you €5,000,001."<br>
      "The price is €8m."<br>
      "We'll give you €5,000,002."<br>
      You get the picture... However, we did manage to get this former Man City world domination pawn in in time to look excellent in pre-season and the first 30 minutes of the Premier League season before <a href="spurs-h.html">getting nobbled by Kane</a>.<br>
      <br>
      Next in was <span class="player-highlight">Jacob Murphy</span> in a deal that seemed to follow the Lejeune negotiating tactics. It was around this time it became apparent that we somehow had no money - missing the first year of squillion pound Premier League TV money seems to have hurt us more than we realised, which will no doubt perversely delight Mike Ashley as he takes to television to tell us deluded Geordies that he sadly can't compete with Bruce Wayne, Montgomery Burns, Scrooge McDuck and Smaug like we keep asking him to. Oh, you said Bournemouth? Well, we can't compete with them either.<br>
      <br>
      To confirm this point, we then signed <span class="player-highlight">Javier Manquillo</span> in a move that delighted our friends from wearside following his disappointing loan spell with them last year. However, a bit of digging seems to reveal that David Moyes played his part in Javier's form last year, hooking him after his best performance of the season and rarely playing him after that. Rafa cited his potential, his flexibility (he can play across the back four) and his penchant for chorizo and Sangria as reasons for his signing, and he's looked much as we might have expected in the early part of his Toon career.
