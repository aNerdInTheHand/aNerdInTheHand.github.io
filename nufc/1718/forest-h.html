        <!-- MAIN REPORT -->
        <p class="match-report-text">
          My wife had the rare pleasure of attending this game after my mate Dave ended up on the pitch. Unfortunately, he was leading the lads from the foundation in a half-time penalty shoot-out, but Dave would have been more use at the back tonight than Grant Hanley.<br>
          <br>
          Mrs aNerdInTheHand had predicted goals and entertainment, and she was right on both counts, although the latter didn't really apply to Newcastle fans. Why does it seem that the entertainment is always at our expense? Not that there was any sign of the punishment to come in the opening minutes, when the superb Aarons danced through the defence and played in Mitro, who did what I'm convinced he would do on a regular basis given the chance - namely, booted it into the top corner.<br>
          <br>
          Rafa had put out a side of bairns and rejects to try and protect his limited assets for the visit of West Ham on Saturday. Of the bairns, Sterry and Barlaser have been around the first team set up for a little while now but both looked a little way off being ready for this level. Barlaser did OK but was harried all game and Sterry didn't manage to form much of a connection with Murphy. Early days however and these lads look like being potential squad players in the not too distant future, luck and hard work dependent.<br>
          <br>
          Aarons however - I firmly believe that if he hadn't been injured for the last 25 years he'd be nowhere near us now (he'd have been off to somewhere like Man City on DEADLINE DAY, leaving us crying a lack of time to to spend the money). In other words, he looks to me like a talent I haven't seen come through our academy in my lifetime. I've seen players come through - Shola, Sammy, Steven Taylor, Andy Carroll, Adam Campbell, Adam Armstrong (who sadly I think will go the way of Adam Campbell - prove me wrong!), Paul Huntingdon, David Edgar - all of whom looked like they might come in and do alright. Some even did. But I don't think I ever saw any of them as being world-beaters. From the admittedly little we've seen of Rolando Aarons, I genuinely think he's got bags and bags of talent. His off field antics are worrying (with a court case for assault pending) but, without excusing that, I can understand to a small degree that he must have had a frustrating few years. I would absolutely love to see this lad do it for Newcastle. Under Mike Ashley that clearly won't happen, he'll be off at the first decent bid, so I suppose the best I can hope for is to see him light up one, injury-free season. <span style="font-style: italic;">Deluded Geordie.</span><br>
          <br>
          Aarons capped off his performance with a cracking right footed goal in first half stoppage time, but by this time that was only enough to send us in at the break level. That was in no small part down to the antics of Grant Hanley, who looked about as enticing in the shop window as a 70% off mackem kit in Mike Ashley's sports emporium on Northumberland Street. That we've managed to shift him, for actual money as well, to Norwich only shows that they weren't watching him tonight. You know that scene in Home Alone 2 where Marv is skidding along on the spilled paint in the basement? Watching Hanley tonight was like watching an outtake of that scene that was re-shot as he was too all over the place.<br>
          <br>
          Mbemba was uncharacteristically shaky at CB and Darlow didn't look convincing. Gamez looked to my eye better than some have given him credit for, but all in all this was a shocking night for the defence. Of the midfield, Aarons aside it was poor again. Murphy really struggled, particularly in his finishing which was awful all night. He's a player I rate highly though and he'll have better nights than this. Only Saivet of those we're looking to shift actually put in a half decent performance. Far too little, far too late however. Up top, Mitro had one of his 'hard working' nights, but struggled to bring anybody into the game through no real fault of his own.<br>
          <br>
          Although the visitors looked the more likely, nobody could find a goal in the second half so we went to an unwanted extra time. The one bonus of this was seeing history made at St James' Park, when as per the rules of this competition Joselu became our first ever fourth substitute in a game! By this point though, Forest had scored a third and that was all she wrote. So, despite Ashley's frankly bizarre interview in which he said he expected us to have a go in the cups this year, Rafa didn't feel he could risk a first team squad tonight. Whether he truly expected us to go through with the team he put out is largely a moot point, but I didn't, prophetically claiming a 'bad feeling about this' before the match.<br>
          <br>
          But hey, at least the Missus had a good night out, we actually saw some goals, and we can 'concentrate on the league' like we have with so much success in recent years.
