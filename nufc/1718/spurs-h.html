        <!-- MAIN REPORT -->
        <p class="match-report-text">And so, after 40 years of wandering the desert (or at least 100 or so days without football), we died within sight of the promised land of an opening day point. Don't worry, I won't Google any more religious references - if Newcastle really was a religion, we'd all have lost faith long before now.<br>
        <br>
        But even taking into account the fact that nobody really expected a repeat of the last time Spurs came here, the ground seemed a little bit flat after kick off. Maybe it was the backdrop of uncertainty about Rafa leading up to the game, the increasing rumours that we can't compete financially with Gateshead, and the lack of much needed forward reinforcements. Or maybe it was just the fact that we couldn't get near Spurs as they held us at arms length. Don't get me wrong, we were holding our own OK, but there was precious little to get bums off seats. The main talking point of the first half was a shocker of a tackle by Beavis and Butthead lookalike Harry Kane on Florian Lejeune, the pick of the summer signings in pre-season, that would have resulted in jail time for a certain Serbian nutjob. A yellow card was deemed sufficient for Kane.<br>
        <br>
        And so we made it to the break at 0-0, never looking hugely troubled but looking even less likely to score. Perez looked as though he'd spent the summer trying to shed what little muscle he'd had previously, Ritchie was running himself into the ground in the manner of a dog watching the postman sticking sausages through every other door on the street (i.e. furiously, but impotently) and as for Gayle... is he fit? Rafa claims that he is, but that he's not mentally convinced about his hamstrings - in which case he might as well be bloody injured if he's wrapping himself in cotton wool. He never once looked like troubling the Spurs backline. Is he up to the standard of the Premier League? For my money he's a decent finisher but going to struggle in this team if he's playing up top on his own.<br>
        <br>
        The second half kicked off in similarly somnolent conditions, at which point Jonjo Shelvey decided to wake everybody up. Everybody who follows football knows that Dele Alli is, for want of another phrase, a horrible little scrote - absolutely wonderful footballer, don't get me wrong, but the absolute epitome of gamesmanship. Everybody also knows that Jonjo isn't exactly thick skinned. So it was no real surprise that, when Alli prevented Jonjo from picking up the ball for a free kick, Jonjo didn't take into account the proximity of the referee (5 yards), the Sky cameras broadcasting to millions, or the words of wisdom of the psychologist he's supposedly been seeing. No, instead he just stood on Alli's ankle. Absolutely pathetic. If he was going to get himself sent off, he could at least have kicked Alli's head clean off. It might be transfer silly season, but unfortunately there'll be no clubs daft enough to take this nugget off our hands, and good player or not, you've got to think he's past help with this daft behaviour. It's also worth pointing out at this point that he'd had a quiet game, not getting the time on the ball he had the luxury of last season. Maybe that frustration played its part, but that's no excuse for this moronic let down of a bollock dropping.<br>
        <br>
        From then on it was a procession, and it was no surprise when Spurs scored, and even less of a surprise that it was Alli. Ben Davies got a second not long after and it was more luck than skill that the floodgates didn't then open. The only small positive in a punishing second half was a bright display from Atsu, picking up where he left off last season. The gains he made down the left were totally wasted however, as there was (understandably to some degree) very little in the way of support for him.<br>
        <br>
        I'm writing this with two weeks worth of hindsight after smashing West Ham and, even better, getting shot of Emmanuel Riviere, so it would be cheating to go on to predict deepening gloom and doom followed by a shot in the arm in our third league game. Instead I'll just summarise by saying this game started out as a free hit and ended up a write off. Thanks Jonjo.
