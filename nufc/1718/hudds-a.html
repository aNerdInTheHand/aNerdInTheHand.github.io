        <!-- MAIN REPORT -->
        <p class="match-report-text">
          This was such a dispiriting display of football that I can barely be bothered to write about it. We came set up to try and repeat the smash and grab that had worked to such good effect in the Championship a few months ago here, but with the exception of a superb save from Lossl to deny Ritchie a curling snapshot from the edge of the box, this was a shocking performance. There was no fight (notable exception Hayden), and when you have as little quality as there is in this squad, fight is not an optional extra.<br>
          <br>
          Nobody was shocking, with the exception of the ghost of Dwight Gayle up front - the caveat being that he had no service whatsoever. However, Gayle is one of those players who scores goals, and that's it. If he's not scoring goals - and I don't see him scoring goals in this team - then he offers nothing to the team. This was highlighted by the decent shift put in by debutant Joselu, who replaced Gayle early in the second half and was probably our brightest spark on a day when we had no ideas, no heart and no options. Huddersfield have had an incredible start to the season, this game coming after a 3-0 opening day win at Frank de Boer's Palace, but don't let the scorelines fool you - this was the easier game for our fellow promoted side.<br>
          <br>
          It looked like we improved slightly in the second half, but this seemed to be because Huddersfield let us have the ball, possibly on the implicit agreement that we didn't do anything with it. A day of very little positives then, and this is our lot - I write this after the most dispiriting transfer deadline day in Toon history, and we've had a few. Let's hope this lot get their arses in gear, and sharpish, or it's back to the Championship we go.
