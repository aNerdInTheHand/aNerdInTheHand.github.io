        <!-- MAIN REPORT -->
        <p class="match-report-text">
          Whether this was an exercise in crack papering or a display of what this team is actually capable of on its day, this was a much needed breath of fresh air at St James' Park. The growing unease at the poor  start to the season (the scorelines underlined by some pretty negative performances) was blown away in a committed and entertaining 90 minutes against an awful West Ham side.<br>
          <br>
          This result has to be taken at face value. We beat a team who came waving the white flag from the off, but as the saying goes, you can only beat what's in front of you (or usually not in our case). It also has to be taken in context of the shockingly unshocking end to the transfer window in which we tried really, really hard to get Southampton's third choice left back <span style="font-style:italic;">over the line</span> and also attempted to cancel Lazaar's loan to Benevento. Desperate. So this is what we have, and this is what our first team (sans the injured Lejeune) can do when they put their minds to it. Whether that's enough, only time will tell, but we won't face many easier games. That said, there was enough on show today to engender at least a modicum of positivity.<br>
          <br>
          Chief amongst the positives was the performance of two new signings. Try-before-you-buy Spanish U21 Mikel Merino looked class, getting stuck in but also with an eye for a pass that will have Jonjo sweating the fact that he no longer looks irreplaceable. And 27th choice striking transfer target Joselu looked a hell of a lot better than many of us would have expected, not only putting in a good performance for himself that saw him bag the first goal of his Toon career, but bringing his supporting team mates into the game in a way that has been sorely missed in recent years. If nothing else, he deserves credit for making Perez look like a footballer again.<br>
          <br>
          Having swept home the opener following a beautiful through ball from Merino and cut back from Atsu, Joselu found space down the channels and continued to work hard. Hayden and Ritchie never gave their opponents any peace at all and Clark and Lascelles kept the Little Pea at bay. Into the second half and the superb Ciaran Clark took centre stage, first appearing out of nowhere to block a Chicharito snap shot on the line after Elliot had spilled (Elliot then recovered well to claw it away) and then popping up at the other end to nod home a lovely right-footed centre from Ritchie.<br>
          <br>
          And then came the Mitrovic show... As is often the case, it was from the sublime to the ridiculous (or in this case, the other way round), as he borrowed Shelvey's brain cell for a moment to elbow Lanzini in the head off the ball. Luckily for us, this was missed by the ref, although not by the gleeful pundits calling for a 10 year stretch after the game. Luckily, because after blasting one good chance straight at Joe Hart, he put a gleeful third past the self-proclaimed England's Number One (who isn't very good and has dandruff, according to my favourite chant of the day). Our mad number 45 held his line perfectly to take down a cute chipped through ball from Perez, who was flattened in the process - credit to the ref for playing advantage and the linesman for getting a tight offside call right - then left poor Joe on his arse to walk the ball into the net.<br>
          <br>
          A performance, then, to match the atmosphere, which had been superb all day. Gallowgate flags made a point by displaying only a single flag, that of our lord and saviour Rafa Benitez, who was seranaded all afternoon by his adoring disciples. For the first time this season, his team also did the business on the pitch. This is it now until at least January, and given that we clearly have a discipline issue in the squad, it's going to be a long three months. On the basis of today though, at least it may not be all gloom and doom.
